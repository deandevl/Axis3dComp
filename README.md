Axis3d-comp
==============

An experimental Vue.js component using [Babylon.js](https://doc.babylonjs.com/) 3d library.  The component draws a x-y-z 3-d axis.

To run the demo do the following:

1. Have `npm` installed and install the `http-server` package locally/globally.
2. At a terminal/command window set the current directory to the `dist-prod` folder.
3. Enter `http-server` at the command prompt -- the server should respond listening at `localhost: 8080`.
4. From a Chrome/Firefox browser enter `localhost: 8080` for the url.
5. An x-y-z 3-d axis should be displayed on the browser's canvas element.
